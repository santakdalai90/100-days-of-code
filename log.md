# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Garbage Collector in Golang and Benchmarking in Golang

**Thoughts:** I had known the Garbage Collector takes care of many things a developer need not worry about, but going through this exercise made me aware of the constrained environment in which it works. Furthermore I got to know about benchmarking.

### Day 2: October 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started a course on web development using Golang. Revised structs, interface, composition, composite literals, and slices

**Thoughts:** I have managed to work on couple of frameworks but never have been able to get formally trained on web development using Golang. So I am using this opportunity for that.
