# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Garbage Collector in Golang and Benchmarking in Golang

**Thoughts:** I had known the Garbage Collector takes care of many things a developer need not worry about, but going through this exercise made me aware of the constrained environment in which it works. Furthermore I got to know about benchmarking.

### Day 2: October 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started a course on web development using Golang. Revised structs, interface, composition, composite literals, and slices

**Thoughts:** I have managed to work on couple of frameworks but never have been able to get formally trained on web development using Golang. So I am using this opportunity for that.

### Day 3: October 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about text templates in Golang and how to pass data, struct, slice, map, etc to it.

**Thoughts:** I have never worked with Golang text templates. It seems to be a nice way to organize your code and get rid of string literals from your code.

**Apologies for 2 days of delay**

### Day 4: October 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Created a twitter client application using Golang to retweet and like #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

**Thoughts:** I have always wanted to create a twitter client for long. But there were many hiccups like setting up an application in twitter, understanding about OAuth1.0, etc. It took courage and persistence to complete this.

**Commiting 1 hour of coding daily along with job priority is not easy, hence I would be completing 100 days of code in 5 months**
