# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Garbage Collector in Golang and Benchmarking in Golang

**Thoughts:** I had known the Garbage Collector takes care of many things a developer need not worry about, but going through this exercise made me aware of the constrained environment in which it works. Furthermore I got to know about benchmarking.
